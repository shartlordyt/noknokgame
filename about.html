 <h1> About </h1>           
 <h1> I've always been a fan of making unblocked apps sites and finding new ones, but my last few attempts have been pretty bad. I've gotten better at html/css and just gotten more technically literate in the last year so i thought, why not make a new site? So in early september, I started to build the site... Let's just say it's not perfect but it's a lot better than what i had before... I've learned how to use new tools like git and emulator.js! Making this site has been a lot of fun from learning how to do some cool things with html (thanks w3schools lol) and just making it so people can use their favorite apps at school! I gotta say my biggest inspirations have to be 3kh0, the emulation scene in general, and everyone using the site! I strive to make it better for you guys! </h1>                               
<h1> I abandoned the site for a few months, but ive come back to avoid legal issues, add more games, and remove images for faster load times.! </h1>
